## 🎉 Installation and setup

This project was initialised through `create-react-app` and so the general setup process follows suit.

To install the latest dependancies:

```
  npm i
```

Then to run a local development server:

```
  npm start
```

## ✔️ Testing

This project contains rudimentary end-to-end testing through [**cypress**][c]. To open the cypress test suite you can run:

```
  npx cypress open
```
Or, to simply run all cypress tests:
```
  npx cypress run
```

* Note: to run cypress tests, the local development server will need to be running in the background for cypress to connect to.

## 🏁 Closing words

I'd personally like to thank Green for the opportunity of allowing me to undertake this task and I hope it's at least satisfactory to the requirements. If there is any feedback, positive *or* negative, please feel free to send it to [contact@cameronthornton.dev](mailto:contact@cameronthornton.dev). I hope to hear from you soon and I give my best regards!
